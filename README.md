# Django REST Framework & Docker

## Author: Ashley Casimir

## Overview

Used Django REST Framework to create an API, then “containerize” it with Docker.

## Set it up

Use the following commands to set up the project:

After you fork and clone down the repository follow the commands bellow

```Bash
$ cd django-rest-framework-api
$ poetry install
$ poetry shell #to enter virtualenv
$ python manage.py runserver
```

And as easy as that you are ready to go! Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/tools on you web browswer an you should be up and running!
